    <string name="primeta1">The behavior of animals such as dogs, deer, and birds can serve as an indicator of the weather. For example, if dogs dig a hole deeper, this may indicate severe frosts. If the deer try to hide from the wind, it may portend an impending storm. Wind direction and strength:  Yakuts pay attention to the direction of the wind and its strength. A wind from the north or northeast may indicate the arrival of cold frosts, and a wind from the west or south may predict milder weather. Clouds and the color of the sky:  Special attention is paid to the clouds and the color of the sky. For example, a red sky at sunrise is often associated with cold and clear weather, whereas a gray sky can portend a cloudy day. Plant behavior:  Some plants may react to changes in the weather. For example, the closing of cones on Christmas trees or the narrowing of leaves in mountain ash can predict a long and harsh winter period. Traditional signs:  In the Yakut culture, there are many traditional signs and beliefs related to the weather. For example, the depth of cracks in ice on rivers can be interpreted as a sign of future frosts.</string>
    <string name="primeta_title_2">The legend of the Yakut Golden Planet</string>
    <string name="primeta2">A long time ago, in the time of the ancient Yakuts, it was believed that there was a Golden Planet in the sky that controls all weather phenomena on Earth. This planet was inhabited, and the weather gods lived on it.  The legend tells how the gods on the Golden Planet gathered together every day to decide what kind of weather they would send to Earth. However, as elsewhere, there were disputes and disagreements among the gods.  One day, one of the gods decided to cause a snowfall on a warm summer day to show his power. But the other gods did not agree with this idea, and a dispute began. As a result, the gods quarreled and stopped controlling the weather.  This led to chaos on Earth. The heat started in winter, and it snowed in summer. People suffered from unexpected weather conditions, and this forced them to turn to priests and shamans for help.  Eventually, Yakut shamans and priests set out on a journey to the Golden Planet to beg the gods to restore balance in the world. They went through hardships and were able to persuade the gods to end their differences and regain control of the weather.  According to legend, after that, the weather gods began to listen more attentively to people\'s prayers and requests, and the weather became more predictable.  This legend emphasizes the importance of weather in the life of the Yakut people and their connection with nature and spirits. She also conveys the lesson that balance and respect for nature and deities are important to ensure harmony in the world.</string>
